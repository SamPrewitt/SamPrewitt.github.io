### How to Use
 1. Suspension PSI
     * Before using the Jekyll, a rider should make sure front and rear suspension have the proper PSI (pounds per square inch) for their weight. 
     * See Fox Air Pressure Chart below.  ![](SJ_pressure.jpg)  
  
 2. Seat Height  
     * When suspension is set up properly the rider should adjust seat height. 
     * Seat height is based on the rider's leg being fully extended when pedaling. 
 3. Brakes
     * Pull both brakes and try to push the bike around. If it seems stable then you are ready to ride! 
     * If not, go to your local bike shop from [Step 3](#how-to-order) of *How to Order* and find one.

### FAQ
How's the ride?  
* With 29in wheels and 150mm of suspension travel the Cannondale Jekyll 29 2 will roll over about any obstacle. So on the mountain this bike's ride is fantastic! However, for road or gravel biking, the Jekyll would not be ideal.

Where can I find trails?  
* Download [TrailForks](https://www.trailforks.com/) on IOS or Android to be shown a map of local trails anywhere in the US or Canada.

What equipment do I need to safely ride?  
* Most mountain bike trails only require a helmet, MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) is recommended. At lift-assited bike parks riders should wear a full face helment and full body pads. Call your local trail management organization for further information on riding safely.
