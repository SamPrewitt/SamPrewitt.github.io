### FAQ
How's the ride?  
* With 29in wheels and 150mm the Cannondale Jekyll 29 2 will roll over about any obsatcle. So on the mountain this bike's ride is fantastic but about anywhere else it would be less than ideal. 

Where can I find trails?  
* Download TrailForks on IOS or Android to be shown a map of local trails anywhere in the US or Canada.

What equipment do I need to safely ride?  
* Most mountain bike trails only require a helmet, MIPS is recommended. At lift-assited bike parks riders should wear a full face helment and pads.
